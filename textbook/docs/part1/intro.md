# Welcome to Physical AI

> "The future of AI is physical. Intelligence that can only think is incomplete; true intelligence must also act."

## What You'll Learn

Welcome to **Izma's Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook** — your comprehensive guide to understanding and building intelligent machines that interact with the physical world.

## Why Physical AI Matters

Physical AI represents the next frontier in artificial intelligence. While language models have achieved remarkable success in the digital realm, the real world presents unique challenges:

- **Uncertainty**: Physical environments are noisy and unpredictable
- **Real-time constraints**: Robots must make decisions in milliseconds
- **Safety**: Mistakes in the physical world have real consequences
- **Embodiment**: Intelligence emerges from the interaction between mind and body
