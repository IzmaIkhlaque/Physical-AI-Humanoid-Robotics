# AI for Robotics Overview

![AI Perception Pipeline](/img/diagrams/ai-perception-pipeline.svg)

## Introduction

The intelligence of a robot comes from its AI systems. In Part 3, we explore the cutting-edge AI techniques that enable robots to perceive, plan, learn, and communicate.

## The AI-Robotics Stack

Modern robots use a layered AI architecture from high-level reasoning with LLMs down to low-level motor control.

## Key Technologies

| Technology | Application |
|------------|-------------|
| CNNs | Image classification, object detection |
| Transformers | Language understanding, sequence modeling |
| RL (PPO, SAC) | Learning from rewards |
| Diffusion Models | Motion generation |
