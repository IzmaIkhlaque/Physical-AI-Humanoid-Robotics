# Humanoid Robotics Overview

![Humanoid Anatomy](/img/diagrams/humanoid-anatomy.svg)

## Introduction

Humanoid robots represent one of the most ambitious challenges in robotics engineering. By mimicking the human form, these robots can navigate environments designed for humans, use human tools, and interact naturally with people.

## What Makes Humanoids Special?

### Bipedal Locomotion
Walking on two legs is incredibly complex. Humans spend years learning to walk, and our brains constantly process balance, momentum, and terrain information.

### Manipulation
The human hand has 27 bones and over 30 muscles, enabling extraordinary dexterity. Robot hands attempt to match this capability with sophisticated mechanisms.

### Human Interaction
Humanoids are designed to work alongside humans, requiring natural language understanding, gesture recognition, and safety-first design.

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| DOF | Degrees of Freedom - independent joint movements |
| CoM | Center of Mass - body weight concentration point |
| ZMP | Zero Moment Point - key for bipedal balance |
