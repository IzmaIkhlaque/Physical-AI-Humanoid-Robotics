# Key Concepts in Physical AI

## Degrees of Freedom (DOF)
The number of independent parameters defining a system configuration.
- Human arm: 7 DOF
- Humanoid robot: 30-50 DOF

## Kinematics vs Dynamics
- **Kinematics**: Motion without forces
- **Dynamics**: Motion with forces

## Forward vs Inverse Kinematics
- **FK**: Joint angles to end-effector position
- **IK**: Target position to joint angles

## Control Theory
PID Control is the foundation of robot motion control.

## Key Takeaways
:::tip Summary
- DOF determines robot capability
- Kinematics deals with motion geometry
- PID control is foundational
